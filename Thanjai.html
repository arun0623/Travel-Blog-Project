        <p>King Raja Raja Chola I was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva, Hinduisms powerful god of creation and destruction. The Big Temple and Lord Shiva's bull aren't the only things that are notably large. The Big Temples inner sanctum also contains one
            of the biggest Shiva lingams (stone symbols of Lord Shiva used in worship) in India. The polished black lingam is nearly four meters (13 feet) tall and is said to weigh about 20 metric tons. Legend has it that the king wanted a suitably impressive
            symbol, which outdid other temples, to honor Lord Shiva whom he worshiped in the form of Rajarajeshwara (Lord of Raja Raja). Do note that the inner sanctum remains closed daily between noon and 4 p.m. </p>
