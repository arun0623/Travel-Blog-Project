        <p>
            Although Nilgiris were reigned by Ganga and Hoysala Kings but later Tipu Sultan extended his borders to cover these valleys under his kingdoms. Ooty was a pricy possession of Tipu Sultan, which got transferred to The East India Company in 1799 under treaty
            of Srirangapatnam. John Suvillian, the collector of Coimbatore district in 1819, visited this enchanting hill station in 1832 and he was so fascinated by the location that he initiated the construction of roads to the connectivity of this
            place. Since then this beautiful hill station was a much visited recreation to the then, British officials of India. The charm of these enticing green valleys still inspires people from India and abroad.

            <h6>Day 1 in Ooty</h6>
        </div>
        <li>Less than 3 days to be more accurate. As we reached Ooty, it was already over 12 in the afternoon. Our hosts suggested a place to dine in where it cost us much more than anticipated. We spent around Rs. 350 per person, it was EXPENSIVE.</li>
        <li>With the plastic ban in Ooty, no junk skims on the roads, coffee shops offer hot chocolates in ceramic mugs rather than disposable cups, and the cold makes the smokes of grilled corn makes all the more pleasing.</li>

        </div>
        <li>We turned back to the chocolate factory. For a mere Rs. 30 or so for each person, they took us for a tour around the processing of cacao to make chocolates and the tea processes… and we got a bar of chocolate each! Some white and some dark chocolates.
        </li>
        <li>With so many chocolate and tea factories in Ooty, it is difficult to describe which exact one did we visit. But to pinpoint, it lay next to the Eagles Dare Adventures a site for sports like Sky Bridge walk, ziplining, and wall-climbing.</li>

    <div class="Lakes">
        <h6>Pykara Lake</h6>

        </div>
        <li>With none of the activities here in our budget, we headed to another nature spot after the tour the Pykara Lake. </li>

    <div class="boats">
        <h6>Ooty Lake Boating House</h6>
        <div class="Boat">

        </div>
        <li>The Ooty lake stands as one of the most popular spots to visit and the boating house even more. This is a fun-vee spot for kids with features of an amusement park, a tiny train track, and paddle boats.</li>
        <li>There were more like shooting range spots. But it stood on the expensive range of activities. Moreover, it did not seem worth it as we could find all of these activities back home.</li>
        <h6>Conclusion and Trip Budget</h6>
        <li>We came back to our Uni campus in time, a little over 7 in the evening. It was an exhausting ride back but it was an experience worth all of it. We got to see another elephant in the reserve and yet we wished we took a ride on the Ooty toy train.
        </li>
        <li>But overall, the trip was worth it.</li>
        <li>We spent around Rs. 6000 per person and most of it was unsurprisingly for car fuel. The villa was much cheaper (around Rs. 300-400 per person per night) and the food got a little expensive.</li>
        <li> Some activities like boating and the entrance fee to many of the activities contribute to the rest of the expenses.</li>
        <li>The extra expenditure went on some of the street side food like corn, and carrots, and not to mention the irresistible beanie pom beanie caps. I got two myself!</li>
        <li>I hope this post on the Ooty travel blog made your day better.</li>
