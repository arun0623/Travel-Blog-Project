            <h5>5. Best time to Visit Yercaud</h5>
            <p>Yercaud weather is that of tropical mountain weather, classic to the ghat areas and hence offers a great environment for exploring all year round. The summers are cool and pleasant and winters are dry and chilly. Monsoons usually have heavy
                rainfall but are also scenic. However, it's best to avoid the hilly roads during the rainy season. The best time to visit this place is between October and June when it's dry and cool and the temperature is comfortable enough to go sightseeing.
                If you want to experience the local life and folk culture, then visit in May, when the town hosts a seven-day Summer Festival with religious events, flower shows, boating races, village fairs etc. </p>
